# Spam Filter Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based spam filter capable of outperforming spam detection of free email providers. 
By using our knowledge and techinques in machine learning we attempt to:
1. identify emerging patterns and trends in spam and phishing tactics
2. enhance our collective ability to recognize phishing content and provide a
   more thorough defense as phishing attacks become increasingly sophisticated.

We aim to make phishing detection a more accessible and undeerstandble  to more vulnerable groups like the elderly and children.

## Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to explore our data and identify what makes an efficient spam detector. Our goal is to acheivve at least an 80% 
accuracy rate in filtering spam and indentifying spam trends to help improve educatinal efforts on spam recognition.

## Summary

The KNN model shows to be the best machine learning model to achieve a accuracy rate above 80%. From our exploratory data analysis we were able 
to only scratch the surface of how KNN was able to classify from our dataset and interestingly give us insight into the extreme outliers of the datset 
which was a valuble tool in identifying what emails were not 


## Considerations
For future developement, exploring or incorporating deep learning approaches for text classification could imporove performance.
Incorporating user feedback to update and/or evolve the model based on new spam trends could improve the effectiveness of classification.
